#String Methods
these string methods I used a name variable so just keep that in mind


#print (len(name)) Check how long your name variable is
#print (name.find("B")) How to find what letter is where 
#print (name.capitalize()) capitlize the first letter of the name variable
#print (name.upper()) make everything upper case instead of Ballon it will be BALLON 
#print (name.lower()) make everything lowercase
#print (name.isdigit()) determines is the string is a digit
#print (name.isalpha()) determines is the string is an alphabet alpha for short
#print (name.count("l")) counts how many of one letter is in your string
#print (name.replace("o","a")) replace a letter with another one 
#print (name*3) repeates a name then amount of times you want it to
