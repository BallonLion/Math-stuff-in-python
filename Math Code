Math 
hopefully this python block of code will come in handy in the near futre

#print (round(pi)) round your number to the nearest one 
#print (math.ceil(pi)) round your number to the highest one
#print (math.floor(pi)) round your number to the lowest number
#print (pow(pi,2)) bring the variable to whatever power you want it to be
#print (math.sqrt(420)) finds the square root
#x = 1
#y = 2
#z = 3
#print (max(x,y,z)) finds the max number out of all the options
#print(min (x,y,z)) finds the lowest number out of all the options
